# 🧪 NeuralBleach

> **"If the pixels can dream, they can be made to forget."**

**NeuralBleach** is an advanced steganography removal suite designed to defeat robust, frequency-domain AI watermarks (like Google SynthID, Nano Banana, and invisible latent signatures).

Unlike traditional LSB tools that destroy image quality to remove data, NeuralBleach uses **Generative Adversarial Laundering** with **Structural Locking**. It forces the image through a secondary neural network to hallucinate a mathematically new pixel structure while strictly preserving the visual semantic content (faces, text, and logos).

## Features

### 1. The "Launder" Protocol (Signal Disruption)
Uses **Realistic Vision V5.1** (a photorealistic finetune of Stable Diffusion) to "re-dream" the image pixels.
* **Why:** Robust watermarks rely on specific pixel-grid coherence. By regenerating the image with a `strength` of 0.20 - 0.25, we force a new noise distribution that overwrites the original hidden signal without the "potato face" distortion of older models.

### 2. ControlNet "Structure Lock"
Standard AI tools destroy text and small details. NeuralBleach uses **ControlNet (Canny Edge Detection)** to create a "wireframe" of your image before processing.
* **Result:** The AI is forced to paint *inside the lines*. Text remains readable, logos stay sharp, and faces maintain their identity, even while the invisible pixel data is scrubbed.

### 3. The "Analog" Humanizer (Visual Spoofing)
Detectors don't just look for code; they look for "digital perfection." This module injects physical camera imperfections:
* **Chromatic Aberration:** Micro-shifts Red/Blue channels at the edges to simulate lens light refraction.
* **Film Grain Simulation:** Adds ISO-400 equivalent luminance noise to break the "AI smoothness."

### 4. Metadata Nuke
Automatically strips all **EXIF**, **XMP**, and **C2PA** (Content Credentials) headers, ensuring no digital signature remains in the file container.

## 🛠️ Local Installation

If you have a GPU (NVIDIA RTX 3060 or better recommended), you can run this locally.

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### Usage

```python
# Basic Usage (Default Strength 0.20)
python neural_bleach.py image.png

# Aggressive Mode (If watermark persists)
python neural_bleach.py image.png --strength 0.25 --out output_image.jpg

```

| **2. Laundering** | `Realistic Vision` + `ControlNet` | Overwrite frequency-domain watermarks while respecting the wireframe. |
| **3. Humanization** | `np.roll` + `Gaussian Noise` | Defeat visual "smoothness" classifiers. |
| **4. Sterilization** | `Image.save(quality=95)` | Strip C2PA/Metadata & Header signatures. |
